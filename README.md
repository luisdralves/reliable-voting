# reliable-voting

A simple webapp to enable simple, simultaneous, turn-based polls or contests.

Powered by [create-t3-app](create.t3.gg/)

## Use cases
 - Playing dixit without the pieces or board (voting for a card)
 - ...

## Demo
[reliable-voting.vercel.app](https://reliable-voting.vercel.app)

If you access the root page, you will be assigned a new ID. You can choose your ID by manually navigating to `/[id]`. 

[reliable-voting.vercel.app/0](reliable-voting.vercel.app/0) is the admin, who besides voting can also end and reset the current round.

Supabase will probably take my instance down by the you access it though.
